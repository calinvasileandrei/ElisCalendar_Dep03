# ElisCalendar_Dep03
This python app allow to parse an exel file and retrive all the events from a structured exel which my university provides and convert it into google calendar events through google calendar api. 
The code is smart and after the first push on calendar knows if the calendar in the exel is updated and update also the google events in a smart way (only the single events and delete the one i don't need).
Most of the code is commented and not in the final relese because sometimes our university edits the structure of the calendar, so I left a lot of junk code inside to allow a fast edit in this cases.
